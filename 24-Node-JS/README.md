## Node JS

All the JS up until now was client side front end JavaScript. Node runs JavaScript on server side

## Node Console
- It's own console
- No HTML, CSS: because we're on the server side
- REPL: Read–evaluate–print loop

## NPM
- All the packages(someone else wrote the code) are centralized here
- Has a command line tool
- Easy to install and manage packages

### Installing Packages
```npm install <package-name>```

### Including Pagakes
```var something = require('<pack-name>')```
