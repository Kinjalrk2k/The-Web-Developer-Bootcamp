- Multiple collections in a database and they are related

### Relationships
- one:one
- one:many
- many:many

### Embedding Data
Putting everything in one single object

### Referencing Objects
Putting in differrent objects and referencing

### ```module.exports```
- Helps clean up code and module
- Exporting from a file is like returning from a function: Nothing is exported unless explicitly specified
